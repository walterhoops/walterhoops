- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Walter! Thanks for visiting my Github!
- This is a place for me to share code and archive school/personal projects that I've worked on

- Iâ€™m interested in learning more about how technology helps make our lives easier in meaningful ways
- Iâ€™m currently studying Business IT Management (AI Specialization) at the British Columbia Institute of Technology

- My goal within 5 years is to become a product manager within the tech industry so I can build cool stuff with cool people!
- The first project that made me interested in coding and tech was when I built a Laser People/Occupancy Counter for my engineering class!
- I realized that I enjoyed the intersection between working with tech and people, and making cool things, so that's why I chose product management :)
